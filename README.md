# Generic E2E Pipeline:

The Generic pipeline covers the test for litmus generic experiments which include some before and after chaos validation and performance checks for different litmus components.

### Different Stages:

  <tr>
    <th>Stages</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cluster Connect</td>
    <td>This stage is used for connecting to the OnPrem cluster which is a 4 node cluster(1 master and 3 worker) and clone the litmus-e2e folder</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Install</td>
    <td>This is the Litmus installation stage, in this stage the crds rbacs and the operator are created.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Deploy</td>
    <td>This is the application deployment stage. The application under chaos is deployed and the liveness test for the application is also performed in this stage.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Generic-experiment</td>
    <td>This stage includes the creation of experiments,engine and positive and negative test cases for the experiments.</td>

  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td>App-cleanup</td>
    <td>This is the experiment and application cleanup stage on which all the engines, applications, experiments are removed.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Cleanup</td>
    <td>In this stage, the litmus repo is removed and cluster gets disconnected.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

# OpenEBS E2E Pipeline
It contains the openebs e2e BDDs for OpenEBS experiments. A stateful application (percona) deployed using cstor (OpenEBS Storage class). The chaos is performed on the different OpenEBS components using the same application. In the end, The application, litmus, and OpenEBS are removed successfully.

### Different Stages:
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Stages</th>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Infra setup</td>
    <td>It contains the three jobs Build Litmus which is used to install Litmus, Build OpenEBS which is used to install openebs, App-deploy It is used to deploy application using openebs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Application setup</td>
    <td>In this stage a sample stateful percona application is deployed which will be used to test the openebs experiments</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Experiment</td>
    <td>This stage includes the creation of Chaos Experiments, Engine for the experiments and test cases (BDDs)for the experiments.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Infra Cleanup</td>
    <td>This stage include the set of jobs which will remove litmus,openebs and deployed application.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Application cleanup</td>

  </tr>  
   <tr>
    <td>Cluster Cleanup</td>
