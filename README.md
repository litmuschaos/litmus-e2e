# litmus-e2e
This repository contains the Gitlab e2e pipeline with BDD tests for Generic experiments of litmus. An auxiliary application is deployed in the scope of different scenarios and the chaos is performed on that application then in the cleanup stage it is removed successfully.
## Here are the different stages of the Gitlab pipeline:

# Litmus-OpenEBS E2E 
This repository contains the Gitlab e2e pipeline with BDD and other test cases for OpenEBS experiments. A stateful application (percona) deployed using cstor (OpenEBS Storage class). The chaos is performed on the different OpenEBS components using the same application. In the end, The application, litmus, and OpenEBS are removed successfully.
## Here are the different stages of the Gitlab pipeline:
