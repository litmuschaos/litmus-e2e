### Add a test in E2E Pipeline

If you're writing a _new test_ and your test is ready to be added then follow these steps to add it in e2e pipeline which runs on a VM ware machine using GitLab:

* Add go test command (`go test <test-name>_test.go -v -count=1`) as an arg of sshpass in the Makefile.
* Add a new entry of the test in `.gitlab-ci.yml` (use `make <command>` created above) with a proper stage and job name.
* If any new variable is used then don't forget the export it in [makefile](https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus-e2e/blob/71601229b5522cde0f38b507aaa0657259dbf2dc/Makefile#L7).

### Sign your work

We use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) as an additional safeguard for the LitmusChaos project. This is a well established and widely used mechanism to assure that contributors have confirmed their right to license their contribution under the project's license. Please add a line to every git commit message:

```

The email id should match the email id provided in your GitHub profile. 

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` in git config, you can sign your commit automatically with `git commit -s`. 

You can also use git [aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/tr/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases) like `git config --global alias.ci 'commit -s'`. Now you can commit with `git ci` and the commit will be signed.

## Community

We organize the Litmus into Special Interest Groups or SIGs in order to improve our workflow and to easily manage this community project. The developers within each SIG have autonomy and ownership over that SIGâ€™s part of Litmus.

Like everything else in Litmus, a SIG is an open, community, effort. We thrive on a lively and friendly open-source community. Anybody is welcome to jump into a SIG and begin writing or fixing tests, critiquing design proposals and reviewing code.

SIG-Testing is [here](https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus/wiki/Special-Interest-Groups#sig-testing)!
