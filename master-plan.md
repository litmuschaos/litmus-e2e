## File .master-plan.yml

_.master-plan.yml_ file will contain all the desired test cases for Litmus-Portal. Detailed test cases are derived from this master plan. The test cases will be placed in the repo with enough hints to trace it back to this test case id. It is also used to define or track a manual coverage in the pipeline (as a separate job) which can be used to define the stability of an experiment.

Following is a sample master plan yaml:

```yaml
kind: MasterPlan
metadata:
  name: litmus-e2e-master-testplan
spec:
  tests:
    - tcid: TCID-VMWx-Portal-GUI-Auth
      name: "TCID-VMWx-Portal-GUI-Auth"
      description: "UI Tests for Login and Welcome Modal Functionalities"
      labels:
        test/feature: "Litmus-Portal"
        test/tags: "Basic,UI"
        git/location: "https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus-e2e/tree/litmus-portal/CypressE2E/cypress/integration/Basic_Setup"
        test/status: "Done"

    - tcid: TCID-VMWx-Portal-GUI-MyHub
      name: "TCID-VMWx-Portal-GUI-MyHub"
      description: "UI Tests for MyHub"
      labels:
        test/feature: "Litmus-Portal"
        test/tags: "MyHub Checks,UI"
        git/location: ""
        test/status: "Not Done"
```

## Important points

- Each test case would be specified in individual GitLab jobs in gitlab-ci.yaml.<br>
- The format of adding `tcid` is `TCID-<PLATFORM>-<TEST-CATEGORY>-<TEST-SCOPE>-<ACTUAL-TEST-NAME>`. <br>

  **PLATFORM:** It is the platform where the e2e tests are running.<br>
  **TEST-CATEGORY:** The category of the test. It can be generic, litmus-portal, openebs, or any other.<br>
  **TEST-SCOPE:** Specify the scope of the test. It can be an app for application-level test or infra for infra level test.<br>
  **ACTUAL-TEST-NAME:** The actual name of the test<br>

  **Example:** TCID-VMWx-Portal-GUI-Auth
